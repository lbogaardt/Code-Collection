This repository contains multiple pieces of code implemented in *R* and *Mathematica*. Both types are rendered to `.html` for easy viewing.

## R Code Collection

The pieces of code implemented in *R* are evaluated by the script `R-Code-Collection-Pipeline.R`. The rendered `.html` files are listed on **[R-Code-Collection](R-Code-Collection.html)**.

## Mathematica Code Collection

The pieces of code implemented in *Mathematica* are evaluated by the notebook `Mathematica-Pipeline.nb`. The rendered `.html` files are listed on **[Mathematica-Code-Collection](Mathematica-Code-Collection.html)**.

## Simulation Studies

The simulation studies are evaluated by the script `Simulation-Studies-Pipeline.R`. The rendered `.html` files  are listed on **[Simulation-Studies](Simulation-Studies.html)**.

The simulation studies cover:
- Linear Regression Models
- Mixed Effects Models
- Binary Classification Models
- Ordinal Classification Models
- Multinomial Classification Models
